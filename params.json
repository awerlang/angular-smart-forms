Let's help this process.\r\n\r\nThis project provides some directives to be applied on forms and form elements, \r\nto handle specific requirements not yet covered by native implementations.  \r\n\r\nBehaviours implemented:\r\n\r\n    * Focus first element on page load;\r\n    * Focus first invalid element on submit, in case it fails;\r\n    * Focus next element on pressing ENTER key;\r\n    * Focus next element on completing input an element;\r\n\r\nAll this work is based on the following assumptions:\r\n\r\n* If it is *flexible*, then it would solve most problems, even ones not aimed by the library author's;\r\n* Provide *convenience* without sacrificing flexibility;\r\n* By keeping *code base simple*, it is easier to reason about and evolve;\r\n* By fully covering with tests, it can *evolve without introducing bugs*.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Bower\r\n\r\n    bower install angular-smart-forms --save\r\n\r\n### Application\r\n\r\n#### HTML\r\n\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"release/angular-smart-forms.min.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n#### JavaScript\r\n\r\n    var app = angular.module('app', ['wt.smart']);\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
